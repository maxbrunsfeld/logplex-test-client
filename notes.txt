# Tested
- Running logplex
  - currently, need to create API credentials manually w/ erlang REPL
- Posting logs
  - silently fails if log fmt is wrong
- Retreiving logs
- Tailing logs
  - logplex doesn't set 'Transfer-Encoding: Chunked'

# Known but untested
- Drains
- Redis replication

# Unknown
- Running multiple logplex instances (should work)
- Integrating logplex with existing CF logging infrastructure
